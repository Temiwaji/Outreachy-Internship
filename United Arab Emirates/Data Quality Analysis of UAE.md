## ENHANCING GEOSPATIAL DATA QUALITY FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF UNITED ARAB EMIRATES (UAE)

### Introduction

This project focuses on conducting geospatial analysis to gain insights into the geographic context of United Arab Emirates' land sector data. However, several data quality issues have been identified that impact the accuracy and completeness of the analysis.

### Issues

1. No recorded data exists for UAE's biodiversity hotspot. It seems that information was lost during preprocessing, as column names were retained when attempting to read the dataframes.
2. The JSON files within the land cover dataset lack information specific to UAE, making it impossible to generate relevant maps for the country's land cover.

### Recommendation

Conduct a thorough review of the preprocessing steps to identify where data loss occurred. Revisit data extraction, transformation, and loading processes to ensure that all relevant data for UAE's biodiversity hotspot is captured and integrated into the analysis. Consider engaging with data engineers and domain experts to validate preprocessing pipelines and ensure data integrity.

Implement robust validation and verification processes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of geospatial data sources. Verify the credibility of data providers, cross-reference with authoritative sources, and conduct data quality checks to detect and rectify errors. Engage with subject matter experts to assess data completeness and accuracy, and document validation procedures for transparency and reproducibility.
