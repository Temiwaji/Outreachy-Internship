## ENHANCING GEOSPATIAL DATA QUALITY FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF ARMENIA

### Introduction

This project focuses on conducting geospatial analysis to gain insights into the geographic context of Armenia's land sector data. However, several data quality issues have been identified that impact the accuracy and completeness of the analysis.

### Issues

1. The JSON files within the land cover dataset lack information specific to Armenia, making it impossible to generate relevant maps for the country's land cover.

### Recommendation

Implement rigorous quality assurance procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the geospatial data. This includes data validation, error detection, and verification processes to identify and rectify any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the dataset.
