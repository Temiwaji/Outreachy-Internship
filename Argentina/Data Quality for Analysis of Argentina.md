## ENHANCING GEOSPATIAL DATA QUALITY FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF ARGENTINA

### Introduction

This project focuses on conducting geospatial analysis to gain insights into the geographic context of Argentina's land sector data. However, several data quality issues have been identified that impact the accuracy and completeness of the analysis.

### Issues

1. The JSON files within the land cover dataset (excluding Argentina's planted forests file) lack Argentina-specific information, hindering the generation of relevant maps for the country's land cover

### Recommendation

Conduct thorough validation and verification processes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the geospatial data sources. This includes verifying the credibility of data providers, cross-referencing with authoritative sources, and implementing quality assurance measures to detect and rectify errors.
