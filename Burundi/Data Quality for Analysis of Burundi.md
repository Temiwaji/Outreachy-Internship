## ENHANCING GEOSPATIAL DATA QUALITY FOR COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OFBURUNDI

### Introduction

This project focuses on conducting geospatial analysis to gain insights into the geographic context of Burundi's land sector data. However, several data quality issues have been identified that impact the accuracy and completeness of the analysis.

### Issues

1. Possible due to data entry issues or incomplete documentation occured while recording data for Burundi's Holdridge lifezone
2. The JSON files within the land cover dataset lack information specific to UAE, making it impossible to generate relevant maps for the country's land cover.

### Recommendation.

Implement robust validation and verification processes to ensure the accuracy and reliability of geospatial data sources. Verify the credibility of data providers, cross-reference with authoritative sources, and conduct data quality checks to detect and rectify errors. Engage with subject matter experts to assess data completeness and accuracy, and document validation procedures for transparency and reproducibility.
